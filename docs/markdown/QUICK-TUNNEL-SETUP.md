🚀 **REAL FACE ANALYSIS IN TUNNEL MODE - QUICK SETUP**

✅ **Current Status:**

- Expo is running in tunnel mode (keep it running!)
- Face API server extracted ngrok successfully
- Ready to connect them via ngrok tunnel

🔧 **Next Steps:**

### Step 1: Get Ngrok Auth Token (2 minutes)

1. Go to: https://ngrok.com/signup (free signup)
2. Verify email and login
3. Go to: https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken
4. Copy the authtoken (looks like: 2abc123def456...)

### Step 2: Configure Ngrok (run these commands)

```bash
cd face-api-service
powershell "& './ngrok.exe' config add-authtoken YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"
```

### Step 3: Start Face API + Ngrok Tunnel (I'll help with this)

```bash
# Start Face API (in new terminal)
cd ..
./start-face-api.sh

# Start ngrok tunnel (in another terminal)
cd face-api-service
powershell "& './ngrok.exe' http 3001"
```

### Step 4: Update App (automatic)

- The app will automatically detect the ngrok URL
- Real face analysis will work in tunnel mode!

🎯 **Benefits:**

- ✅ Real face detection (not mock)
- ✅ Works from anywhere (not just same WiFi)
- ✅ Easy to share with friends
- ✅ Professional tunnel URL

📱 **Your Current Setup:**

- Expo Tunnel: ✅ Running (keep this open)
- Face API: ❌ Need to restart with ngrok
- Ngrok: ✅ Ready to use
